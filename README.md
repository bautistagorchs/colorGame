The rules of the game

The rules of the game are simple. The program will show an RGB code and possible options for the user to guess which is correct. The user will be able to play in two levels: the easy one (with 3 colors) or the difficult one (with 6). In any case, the game will allow you to click on all the options until you find the correct one.
